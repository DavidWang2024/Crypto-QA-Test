# Crypto-QA-Test
QA Challenges
Tech stacks:
You can use any languages or tools you feel comfortable with to
complete the tasks (task 1 + task 2).
The whole demo should include:
1. API Test Automation Framework (e.g. test cases / test data /
assertion / env config...)
2. Testing Framework (e.g. Pytest/Behave for Python,
TestNG/Cucumber for Java)
3. Any open source libraries you find useful
Tasks and deliverables:
1. Script / code (through github, etc)
2. Setup guide
A short description on your design, your test cases.
Task 1:
Situation:
You are given an API description document:
https://exchange-docs.crypto.com/#introduction
We want to automate the REST endpoint:
'public/get-candlestick'
The REST API root endpoint:
https://exchange-docs.crypto.com/#rest-api-root-endpoint
The document address of the specific endpoint:
https://exchange-docs.crypto.com/#public-get-candlestick
What is required:
1. Automation the REST API 'public/get-candlestick'
2. The points you usually use for automation
3. Have test cases and test data
4. The code has a clear frame structure
Preferable tech stack:
- Python
- Behave
Task 2:
Situation:
You are given an API description document:
https://exchange-docs.crypto.com/#introduction
We want to automate the Websocket endpoint:
'book.{instrument_name}.{depth}'
The Websocket API root endpoint:
https://exchange-docs.crypto.com/#websocket-root-endpoints
The document address of the specific endpoint:
https://exchange-docs.crypto.com/#book-instrument_name-depth
What is required:
1. Automation the Websocket API 'book.{instrument_name}.{depth}'.
2. The points you usually use for automation
3. Have test cases and test data
4. The code has a clear frame structure
Preferable tech stack:
- Python
- Behav
